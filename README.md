# 📊 Daily SQL Practice with Handwritten Notes

This repository contains my **daily SQL practice**, where I solve problems (mainly from LeetCode) and document:

- SQL queries (`solution.sql`)
- Short problem explanations (`problem.md`)
- Handwritten notes for concepts (`notes.jpg`)

The goal is to build **strong SQL fundamentals** with consistency and clarity.
